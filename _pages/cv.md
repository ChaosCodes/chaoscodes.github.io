Education
======
* B.S. in Sun Yat-sen University, 2020
* Ph.D in Singapore University of Technology and Design, 2025 (expected)


Research  Experience
======
* **One Network, Many Masks: Towards More Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning**, Sept. 2022 -- Jan. 2023
  
  * Presented a novel method that enables efficient sharing of a single prototype Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning network (e.g. adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning) across layers and tasks.
  
* **Unsupervised Non-transferable learning**, Jan. 2022 â€“ June. 2022
  
  * Proposed a novel unsupervised non-transferable learning method for text classification task that can main-
    tain a good performance in the source domain whilst having degraded performance in the target domain.
  
  * Designed a secret key component for recovering the access to the target domain after training.
