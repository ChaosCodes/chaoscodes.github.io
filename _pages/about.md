Greetings! I'm Guangtao Zeng, a Ph.D. candidate at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), where I am expected to graduate in 2025. I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2020, and I am working on natural language processing and large language model.
